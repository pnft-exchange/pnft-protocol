# pnft-protocol

pNFT is an open-source NFT perpetual futures DEX (decentralized exchange), that allows traders and speculators who love NFT assets to go long or short by leveraging NFT floor prices.
The platform is fully decentralized, supported by Arbitrumâ€”the fast and inexpensive L2 scaling solution. With security measures inherited from the Ethereum blockchain.
